## Password Vulnerability Checker:
If we analyze `the most commonly used passwords` throughout the world we'll see that they are not that much hard to guess, rather they are just daily patterns that we use in our day-to-day life. Today almost every social media and other accounts are protected by passwords. But the notable fact is that people are using week passwords. So, this project will help users to locate the vulnerabilities in their passwords.

## Features of the project:
