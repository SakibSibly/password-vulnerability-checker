## Password Vulnerability Checker:
If we analyze `the most commonly used passwords` throughout the world we'll see that they are not that much hard to guess, rather they are just daily patterns that we use in our day-to-day life. Today almost every social media and other accounts are protected by passwords. But the notable fact is that people are using week passwords. So, this project will help users to locate the vulnerabilities in their passwords.

## Features of the project:
- It will analyze the password and run several tests on the given sample.
- Then a verdict regarding the strength of the password will be given.
- It'll also provide a tooltip on how to make the password even stronger.

## Usage:
Inorder to use the tool [g++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) must be availabe in your system. To check whether `g++` is available or not run the following command in the `Terminal` or in the `PowerShell`:
```
g++ --version
```
If the version is visible that means the `g++` is available to use.

- For Linux users:
Execute the commands in the Terminal:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall tool.cpp -o tool
./tool
```
- For Windows users:
Execute the commands in the PowerShell:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall tool.cpp -o tool
.\tool.exe
```
