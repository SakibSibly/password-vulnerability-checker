### Password's Strength Checker:

- 1st year 2nd semester group project of Data Structures and Algorithm Lab.

### Description of the project:

* The project is about analyzing a password that will be given by a user.

* The algorithm will analyze a password and give a verdict regarding the strength of the password.

* It'll also provide a tooltip on how to make the password even stronger based on the indexing system that we followed.

### What is the motivation of the project:

If we analyze `the most commonly used passwords` throughout the world we'll see that they are not that much hard to guess, rather they are just daily patterns that we use in our day-to-day life. Today almost every social media and other accounts are protected by passwords. But still people are using week passwords, at least the numbers of week password users are notable. So, this project will help the users to locate the vulnerabilities in their passwords.
